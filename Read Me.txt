Run game.py to launch game

Click to create a polygon. The game will pause so that you may place your polygon.
Click again to place polygon. There is a small amount of time between placing a polygon and being able to create a new one.

Try to fit as many polygons on the surface. The game ends when a polygon falls below the surface.

*Currently collisions are highly unstable and you will most likely loose if the polygons ever come into contact with each other.
